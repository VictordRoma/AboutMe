    <string name="Bio">hi, may name is Aleks.
\n\nI love fish.
\n\nThe kind tht is alive and swims in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
\nFun like is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
\n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
\nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
\n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and vary hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
\nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though. \n\n
